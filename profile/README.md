libLISA is a tool that can fully automatically scan instruction space, discover instructions and synthesize their semantics.
It relies on as little human specification as possible: specifically, it does not rely on a handwritten (dis)assembler to dictate which instructions are executable on a given CPU, or what their operands are.
